# iPad acceptance checks

Run on the iPad mini 2 with iOS 10.3.3.

## Install

- Install `dist/Solitaire-2.0.0.ipa` (or the `.deb`). Confirm the app opens without a signing error. For the `.deb`, `dpkg -l com.local.solitaire` should show 2.0.0.
- Confirm the home screen shows the new app icon. If the old one appears, run `uicache` as mobile or respring. Check the icon in Spotlight and Settings too.

## Orientation

- Launch in each of the four orientations. The launch image should be black with no letterboxing, and the board should come up in the matching orientation.
- Rotate through all four orientations mid-game. The board must not re-deal, moves and timer keep going, and Undo still works.
- Start dragging a card or stack and rotate. Confirm no card remains floating and the next touch works. Repeat with a card selected (tap-to-select) and confirm the selection clears.
- In portrait, confirm seven columns fit, long face-up runs spread further than in landscape, and corner indices stay readable.

## Controls bar

- Confirm the bar is at the bottom in every orientation: time and moves on the left, Undo, New game, and Settings icons on the right.
- Each icon is easy to hit (44pt or larger). Undo is dimmed until the first move and after undoing everything.
- With VoiceOver on, the buttons read "Undo", "New game", and "Settings".
- New game still asks for confirmation. Cancel leaves the board unchanged; accepting resets moves and Undo and increments games played.
- Win a game and confirm the victory text sits above the bar, not over it.

## Card art

- With no art in `Resources/Cards/`, cards look like v1 (rank and suit text faces, slate lattice back).
- With a partial set, cards with art show it, the rest fall back, and nothing crashes. With a full 53-card set, every card uses the art.
- Flip several cards right after launch and confirm there is no hitch on first flip.
- Corner indices are readable on long and compressed stacks in both orientations.

## Settings

- Settings shows only Statistics (games played, wins, current win streak). There is no Card back or Draw mode section, and every row is visible without scrolling in both orientations.

## Unchanged from v1

- Draw all 24 stock cards, recycle, and check the same draw order returns. Undo a draw and a recycle.
- Drag one card and a multi-card stack to legal and illegal destinations. Invalid drops return without incrementing moves.
- Tap a card and then a destination, including an empty king column. Double-tap an ace or the next foundation card. Covered waste and foundation cards cannot be moved.
- Move a tableau stack that exposes a face-down card. Confirm it flips, then undo and confirm it becomes face-down again.
- Background the app for a minute. The game timer does not advance, and relaunching restores the board.
- Enable Reduce Motion. Move and victory animations are suppressed.
- Play for at least ten minutes in both orientations. Check responsiveness, memory stability, and whether drag motion holds 60 FPS on the A7.
